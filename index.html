            Caleb is just some guy. He drinks coffee he forgot about, stares out of windows,
            and thinks about things that don’t really matter but feel important anyway.
            He works a regular job, comes home tired, and writes stuff like this
            instead of doing laundry.

            <p>
                Mondays feel heavier than they should. Not bad, just… slower.
                I watched the street this morning while waiting for my coffee to cool.
                Someone dropped their keys. Someone laughed. Life kept going.

            <p>
                Took the late bus home today. The city looks different at night,
                like it’s pretending to be quieter than it actually is.
                I kind of like that lie.
